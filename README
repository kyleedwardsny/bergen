* What is bergen? *
*******************

bergen (with lowercase 'b') is a free and open-source drop-in replacement for
the Telemark Assembler (http://home.comcast.net/~tasm). The goal of bergen is
to be able to assemble all Z80 assembly language programs written for the
Telemark Assembler without any modifications. It is intended to be used on all
platforms by people developing assembly language programs for the TI-83 Plus
series of graphing calculators. As such, it may not have all features of the
Telemark Assembler, but it will have enough to write Z80 assembly language
programs.
